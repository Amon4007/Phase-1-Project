# Book Explorer

Book Explorer is a single-page web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can input a search query, and the app will retrieve and display relevant books along with their details such as title, author, cover image, and publication date. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and all API interactions are handled asynchronously using JSON.
